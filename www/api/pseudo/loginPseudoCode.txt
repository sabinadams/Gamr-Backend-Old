1. User fills out login form and submits
2. Client checks for a token in local storage.
	a. If it finds a token, sends it along with the login details
	b. If not, generate a token and send it along
3. Backend determines if an existing token was sent 
	a. If not, it checks the users table to see if a user has the provided email address and password combo
		i. If a user is found it stores the provided token in the sessions table along with the user's ID. Then 
		   it returns the user info along with the token to the client 
		ii. If not, it was an invalid login and an error should be sent back to the client.
	b. If so, it grabs the token from the sessions table and get's the user info from the users table based on the
	   user_ID in the sessions table. Update the timestamp on the token and the user and send everything to the client 
4. The client will recieve the response from the server
	a. If it is an error, display error details
	b. If it is a success, save the user's data into localStorage. You are logged in and ready to go.
